# TheButton

Watch the Reddit button from your Android phones status bar! Set alerts with custom tones.

Never be without the Button again.

There are 2 power management options

1) You can disable the updaing if the screen is off

2) You can enable the updating when the screen is off, while you're connected to power.

Note - The websocket link that I'm hosting at https://s3.amazonaws.com/nebulights.com/thebutton.txt needs to be updated every 24 hours or it stops working.  If anyone knows how to do this automatically so I don't need to update it daily that would be fantastic!  Reddit called me a bot when I tried to scrape it.
