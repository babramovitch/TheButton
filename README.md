# TheButton

Watch the Reddit button from your Android phones status bar! Set alerts with custom tones.

Never be without the Button again.

There are 2 power management options

1) You can disable the updating if the screen is off

2) You can enable the updating when the screen is off, while you're connected to power.

Special thanks to Kefs for the new launcher icon, and artganify for the code to automatically get a new websocket link without reddit considering me a bot and blocking me.
